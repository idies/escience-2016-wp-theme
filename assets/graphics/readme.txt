This folder contains EPS, Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, and other files used to create the logo and banner graphics for escience 2016.

For the letters and numbers I needed to replace, I used the font Candara. It woked ok for the numbers, but may not match the letters very well. You may need to find something different for those. I could not determine the original font used. The original artist had her computer stolen and lost the original files. 

Most fundamental file to look at is escience_logo_2106.eps. It includes some layers that are hidden, but useful because of fonts, scaling, etc. 
Most other files were created from that.
